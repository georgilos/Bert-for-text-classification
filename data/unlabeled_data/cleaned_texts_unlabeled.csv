4990,foxnews yeah well why don't you list all the sexual misconduct cnn and the guy that was masturbating while on a zoom call and got caught. but you won't mention it because it's cnn
4991,"cnn did you happen to ask him how he feels about killing 1000's of gay men in the 80's when he pushed bad aids drugs?yea, didn't think so! you useless clown!"
4992,cnn he is soulless. his eyes prove it. face screaming in fear
4993,cnn it should when you are. just because you put cdc in front of it does not make it law. there are people behind the cdc that will have to answer

4998,"cnn for the amount of marketing they did, the performance was abysmal. with their overhead, it was nowhere near a good return on investment"
4999,cnn screw this little pinhead
5000,news: two of bannon's co-defendants plead guilty to 'we build the wall' fraud via cnn .…
5001,cnn it's why god himself inspired the founding fathers to form the constitution as they did. the revolutionaries did not wish to be subject to the british crown. politicians on both side of the spectrum would do well to remember that the constitution is not a list of suggestions.
5002,cnn seriously?
5003,"cnn and people want to say “i only have a cold, i don’t have covid.” how many times are people going to get this virus? and when are they going to start reporting numbers again? it’s ridiculous."
5004,"what lasted longer, cnn+ or 's pillow company?"
5005,cnn he should rot in prison.
5006,cnn that was predictable
5007,i wonder what kind of abuse she had to put up with from before tina decided to bail - this is a bad trend don’t you think cnn msnbc
5008,cnn sounds made up.
5009,cnn people working the world trade center site after 9/11 got sick from breathing in the asbestos.they were all wearing n95 masks.
5010,"cnn the only thing is that most major executives are judged on how much money they make for their organization. cnn+ had awful subscription rates, and was hemorrhaging money on a product few desired to pay extra to see."
5011,cnn it should have never been an issue until fauci et al raised fingers to the wind and injected politics:
5012,"cnn um, yes they do. you should check the ratings."
5013,cnn why? the death rate is effectively zero. the risks clearly outweigh the benefits.
5014,cnn if he was married 51 years it wasn’t covid that killed him. let’s be rational now.
5015,cnn when u gonna give $$ to fight our border invasion?
5016,spoke with cnn about future of weareables. #teslasuit #cnn

5018,cnn lol oh that’s where their ratings come from.airports.lol
5019,cnn dimwit
5020,"well, he won't be spending much time on cnn+"
5021,cnn what's funny is the handful of people that take cnn seriously won't see the humor in your post. cnn is at least a toxic a name/brand is is guiliani and for the same reason.they've both subverted the truth for their partisan agenda.
5022,cnn i’d buy cnn and take it off the air
5023,cnn exactly! they all air that trash and their ratings are still in the garbage!
5024,"i'm laying the whole mask mandate drama squarely at the feet of the msm. if cnn msnbc had not tried to """
5025,cnn there are no such things as non court issues. fauci is constrained by our laws and constitution just like everyone else.
5026,cnn maybe it’ll be a reality check and they will stop working for evil and garbage corporations
5027,cnn you could have helped so many with the money wasted on this.
5028,"cnn msnbc rating reflect the state of the viewing public. only 38% of americans are college educated. the rest prefer faux news. biden has lowered unemployment, reduced the deficit and passed an infrastructure bill but the poorly educated still love trump and fox. we’re doomed."
5029,"cnn didn’t age well rolling on the floor laughing bye, bye lefties! when is the main cnn channel going!?!?!"
5030,i don't get it. it was like cnn but more. it had a +.person shrugging
5031,cnn flip flop fauci got his feelings hurt.
5032,"cnn ironically, things won’t be on a steady track until he’s gone… man shrugging: light skin tone"
5033,cnn i am shocked that nobody wanted to pay to watch anderson cooper or don lemon talk about parenting.
5034,cnn he is wrong especially if cdc has no standing to do so. fauci isn’t trusted even now. nor is the cdc because we have been told so many different things & yes lied to. children have suffered & still do. enough because we know what this is all about.
5035,cnn king fauci has spoken

5045,cnn of course - they lie to the publicthat causes them to not know truthwhich ends up with you thinking that 
5046,"another dishonest take from the dishonest cnn on the saga. when private corporations inject themselves into politics, they themselves will also have to abide by the same rules they are trying to impose on others. #okgroomers"
5047,cnn this guy is a public menace. it's that simple.

5056,cnn it’s pretty funny. everyone knew it was going to fail.
5057,"cnn oh no, the courts stepped in, after the washington establishment made a political and economic decision. the unspeakable horror weary face how will some people, who should have retired eons ago, will ever survive?"

5069,cnn that will be a disaster
5070,"cnn this is a circumstance of the covid vaccine not being the say all to end all. also masks are not guaranteed either. therefore, common sense kicks in and the public feels as if they have been exploited by fear. is fauci fear mongering.? absolutely."
5071,"cnn covid is rampant in our communities right now. i know people who have it for the third time. as soon as they removed mask mandates from the schools, covid rapidly took hold here again, whole households have it. no covid numbers are being reported either."
5072,cnn things that lasted longer than cnn+. saddam hussein during desert storm.
5073,cnn sure isn’t.
5074,cnn at least he “walked on” nobody walked on cnn plus
5075,"cnn ha ha, no doubt. who watches that garbage anymore?"

5077,cnn somebody had to stand up to don. i'll bet doc fauci didn't even need to tan the old marbles.
5078,cnn they brought amendments to not teach sex. because it doesn't happen and frankly shouldn't. republicans rejected it.
5079,"cnn oh no, how are you going to know who to stand with now? rolling on the floor laughing"
5080,cnn it’s a great example among many of how they are managed and operate.
5081,"not gonna lie, i love to see “woke” ideology crumble. about 7 years late to the party but at least the pendulum is starting to swing back. cnn plus being shut down is absolutely amazing. $250million gone in 1 month has to be a record burn rate."

5088,cnn will you be getting a refund?
5089,"cnn if it were a cdc decision, then perhaps they should have followed the rules to implement that decision within their purview. the court showed clearly that they hadn't. plain and simple. no government organization gets to make unilateral mandates that bypass established procedure."
5090,"cnn its ""unfortunate"" fauci chose to protect himself, china and the us health agencies instead of protecting the world from this virus.it's ""unfortunate"" fauci blocked known valid covid treatments to clear the way for big pharma and himself to make b$$$, instead of saving lives."
5091,cnn as kyle did nothing wrong and he is a minor celebrity that would be appropriate.
5092,"cnn, already failed in reporting biased news then the failed ccn+ what’s next cnn extreme waiting to fail again? grow up."
5093,not all sources are the same. cnn and msnbc might mention the money provided 
5094,"cnn cape breton is beautiful, but ns is not the place to visit right now. covid is rapidly spreading and our hospitals are overwhelmed. until the premier decides to to do his job to keep people safe as promised, please stay home."
5095,cnn it was never true. it is clipart.

5106,cnn this felt like a targeted assault to viewers like myself and others who belong to a marginalized #lgbtq community and it sends out a deeply problematic and very dangerous message. how damaging the bury your gays trope is to the lgbtq community via cnn
5107,cnn so mr. djokovic apparently has become a fan of the covid virus and vladimir putin. next week will he come out in favor of toenail fungus?
5108,"cnn i’ll take things that didn’t happen for $500, alex"
5109,"cnn who wants to tell lord fauci isn’t part of the legislative branch, nor did the people vote for anyone thereface with monocle"

5111,"cnn the fraud is reliably wrong.docs, attorneys, experts of all kinds & lobbyists give advice.public officials consider it & make recommendations to ppl.citizens consider advice, recs & their circumstances, & decide. courts protect our rights from arrogant, tyrannical doofuses."

5125,"cnn schools don't teach sexual orientation/gender identity, but they do teach acceptance. not just on the basis of gender or sexual orientation, but racially and culturally. because they teach diverse groups. you want to turn back time to when some kids were excluded and bullied."
5126,cnn lol. and cnn still won’t admit they’re just propaganda and that’s why people have tuned them out for good.

5163,cnn msnbc i now view mainstream news as a complete waste of

5165,"cnn and : ok, so you've got me begging. i cannot be the only subscriber you have/had? could i be, that it does not make it worth to you to keep ?!"
5166,cnn i missed that part in school when they taught the cdc is the 4th branch of government.
5167,cnn is he going to eulogize cnn+ then too?
5168,maybe cnn & can team up…make cnn & cnn+ the exclusive news partner for netflix & allow ppl to cancel a streaming service they use just for cable news. woman shrugging: light skin tone make cnn+ commercial free as well
5169,cnn we will never see it. should have been sent directly to the people. biden caused all this crap.

5174,"cnn never heard of cnn+, so bad marketing. also, how many scaramucci's is that?"
5175,because cnn is a ratings joke. no one in their right mind would pay for extra media spun bullshit.
5176,cnn i think he want’s more and more. i don’t like greedy people. twitter also doesn’t want to be bought by him. i follow the news very closely
5177,cnn this is because there isn’t a market for cnn+. there is no real journalism at this network anymore.

5182,that's cnn's fault for gaslighting them with hopes and promises they were never going to deliver on.it was quite obvious discovery didn't want them to launch #cnnplus prior to the merger yet the ceo and cfo pushed on anyways.cnn deserves all the criticism and snark they get.
5183,cnn is this why plus was canceled?
5184,cnn that’s crazy considering puberty blockers have been around since the ‘

5186,it is an epic failure of senior management. they screwed over 100’s of associates because they “changed their mind”. the entire executive suite of cnn should be removed with cause (no severance).

5211,cnn you guys should be proud .it's quite the achievement clapping hands
5212,here’s the story: nobody signed up for this crap. cnn already puts out an unbelievable amount of propaganda and there were less people signed up to pay for it than fit in an nba arena.
5213,cnn the inflation we are seeing now is due too supply chain issues and from an overheating economy. i would recommend you learn about economics before making stupid and false statements.
5214,cnn the cdc does not have the authority to make laws. what don't you people understand about that.
5215,"cnn this is the problem folksunelected, unaccountable, bureaucrats think they supersede the courts"
5216,cnn nope you don't get to vote.

6297,"cnn the cdc currently recommends n95s for wildfire smoke and for use if sheltering during a nuclear attack.but they won't recommend them for covid because they have to provide them. and yes, fit them. it's not impossible. we just choose a mass disabling event instead."

6300,cnn people watch them from the cable subscription or on youtube why would customers pay even more with better streaming services out there.not to mention independent media is growing to. cnn has to compete further.

6318,"cnn ""the cdc is a private company, it can do what it wants.""-- anthony fauci"
6319,cnn it's the difference between kids being able to do things this summer and not. it's roughly 5 weeks from initial vax until it reaches full strength (or at least it was w/adults). so thats 6/15 vs 8/1. and we are losing it here trying to protect our under 5s.
6320,cnn you're trying to appear reasonable now to retain your political capital for the next time you demand total power.
6321,"cnn foxnews potus me again; djt vlad’s agent 45-47. i butted heads with jack. ye seem more visionary than jack. i suggest elon ye upgrade an unwieldy town hall. redditize, a subscription, upper story. keep what’s already there, free. cc: huxijin_gt"

6335,"i'll give cnn this: they're giving decent severance packages to people who may not be able to be placed elsewhere in the organization. there are also plenty of broadcast and streaming outlets looking for talent, including & . we're here to help."

6347,cnn and yet you still follow them man shrugging: light skin tone
6348,"cnn what exactly is meant by ""public capital""? because it doesn't seem like requiring masks expends much of any public resources."
6349,"cnn chloe melas loves to use the tactic of playing the victim claiming she and her family receives death threats after her ""brave"" reporting, to avoid accountability. it was not even her who claimed that against morgan freeman fans but pettifogger david vigilante, cnn general counsel"

6358,go cry on cnn and msnbc lol
6359,"cnn he said ""public"". he meant ""political"".and he said ""return"" when he meant ""political return"".b/c public health & economic returns = several thousand to one ($1 spent =1000's back), he's saying your lives aren't worth approval points on polls."
6360,"cnn i understand your point but aren’t you comparing apples/oranges? disneyland is mostly outside+100 kids, proms are mostly inside—not to mention pre/post activities and way more kids."
6361,cnn guns on age deescalation (requiring the vax to be approved for older kids before it can be for younger kids). the right thing to do would be to either ditch age deescalation or approve moderna for the older kids in girls only and approve for all the younger kids
6362,cnn am i allowed to laugh now?
6363,cnn wtf are you talking about?
6364,"cnn i like american news channels and if read my previous thread, only american news channel my astra satellite dish can receive is cnn and bloomberg and over 18 news channels in africa and europe and china. for some reason, american news channels don’t wanna use astra like cnn does."

6374,"7 million people remains under completely siegein tigray,humanitarian aid has been blockade, by the ethiopian government "
6375,cnn maybe because it's related to cnn.

6381,the chinese & americans have an agreement that each can tell the other to destroy any 'secret' documents relevant to their research on corona-viruses! cnn don't you think this is newsworthy?
6382,cnn still not what he said. and also wearing a mask isn't dictating how i live. it's a fuking mask. that's all. nothing else.

6397,cnn be like
6398,"cnn #cnnplus was a result of hack partisan politics, disinformation, swing elections, & propaganda. most don’t care to feel bad for folks who work to produce such content or to such ends. there’s a famous twitter saying #learnto ____."
6399,cnn this would be interesting if it came from a non-fake news source.
6400,"cnn for an organization with its history, 150,000 is a totally sad number. especially with offices, transportation centers, and other waiting rooms.the number is sad. i know some really silly streamers pulling in near that # of paid subs, this is just pathetic."

6413,this took 8 weeks to write. carbon steel pans! cnn
6414,cnn these are the same geniuses who last summer thought that saying “vaccinated people can take off their masks” would encourage the anti-vaxxers to get the shot.
6415,"how anyone could think the vitriol towards cnn has anything to do with chris wallace is mind numbing. the problem is that for 6+ years we have been virtue signaled, submitted to identity politics and generally fed one side of a story. none of that is chris wallace’s fault."
6416,cnn so provide them.
6417,"the phrase, ""if you build it, they will come"" doesn't always work, especially when you're cnn"
6418,cnn i think i know i want to fart in an elevator with.

6451,"cnn didnt care when they were falsely telling american's about russian collusion for 4 years, or its actually hillary behind the collusion, or hunter biden's laptop or lying about kyle rittenhouse or lying about ""peaceful protests"" or pushing the idea of unvaxxed losing jobs."

14043,"cnn: call eleven and sheriff hopper of ""stranger things,"" because netflix's world has been turned upside down."
14044,cnn your silly idea (clearly was embraced by cnn long ago) of “wokeness over facts“ is why they are in a death spiral.normal people (i’m sure your parents can introduce you to a few) have the majority of the money as consumers & yes would pay for a credible/accurate news service.

14063,"hahahaha. they reported on their own suckitude (tm) to get ahead of it.now, when can cnn do the same for itself? honestly not sure there is anything worth saving and pretty sure that just reporting actual news isn't a business model for cable tv with the advent of internet."
14064,cnn no one except you hyped it. come the fuck on.
14065,"hopefully cnn is next, because it's a dumpster fire or ""foxnews lite"""

14091,cnn one of the most signifiant (sic) developments in the history of cnn. that is the very definition of a low bar.
14092,cnn young people today don't know cnn started as a news station. trump exposed them and the others and they all hate him for it.
14093,cnn should have understood that their far left-wing viewers never expect to pay for anything. they feel entitled for everything they want to be free. period.
14094,cnn one look at your timeline shows you aren’t a republican. either that or you have no idea what it means. why be so deceitful?

14102,cnn surprised entire cnn doesn’t shut down. it one of the most worthless bias misinformation outlets.
14103,cnn did germany stay? serious question.
14104,"cnn gop russian type propaganda is due in part to 90% of us media being owned/ controlled by 6 corporations with many gop executives.gop fl is garnering lots of press, spouting off on culture war issues templated by gop think tanks, but he's not pro-freedom."
14105,cnn just outed yourself as a parody account.

14117,"cnn cry more. ""people are still free to wear a mask on planes (and elsewhere) if they so choose. but at this point in the pandemic, with our knowledge and resources, federal mask mandates are unnecessary."" also, nobody voted for the cdc to make policy choices."
14118,"hate to see a media venture fail like this, but cnn should’ve used those resources (and probably will some) to strengthen the network itself. feel the same about peacock, which i wish the best but wonder if it’s better to bolster #nbc and #msnbc and have kept nbcsn. #cnnplus"
14119,cnn it feels like they did a very poor job of promoting this. i think jemele hill is the only person i saw talk about it because she was promoting her new show. that’s how i found out
14120,cnn the failure of cnn+ and lapsing of obama spotify contract are related. shitty establishment content & nonstop lies previously forcefed to us in cable monopoly era simply cannot compete in the free market of streamingthe revolution has just begun

14132,cnn hahah collision
14133,cnn too funny!
14134,cnn foxnews msnbc there was a time when journalists would lose their job for reporting lies and unverified information. they report on what ukraine is peddling w/o verifying it. it is time to hold news orgs accountable. they also eliminate what does not fit their narrative.
14135,cnn so you agree he is trash?
14136,"cnn fox nation is news, not sitcoms"
14137,cnn don’t work for subversive liars in the first place.
