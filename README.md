This repository is part of my thesis on training a LLM like BERT for hatespeech classification using active learning techniques

## Methods presented here:
- Active learning with outliers and low confidence sampling (Active+BERT.ipynb)
- Support pair active learning (test.py)

### The "Active+Bert.ipynb" notebook uses Active learning techniques from Robert Monarch's repo: https://github.com/rmunro/pytorch_active_learning.git 

### The "test.py" uses the method presented in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10008 and the constrained DBSCAN algorithms from the paper  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72530-5_25
